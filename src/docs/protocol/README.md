## Overview

Welcome to the Morphism Documentation.

Morphism is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution with the unique hybrid state verification design.
Rollup technology has long been divided into two categories based on the state verification mechanism used, namely Optimistic Rollup (using Fraud Proof) and ZK Rollup (using Validity Proof). 

Morphism has achieved a balance and harmony between the two by using Validity Proof to verify the Layer2 state and building on the foundation of Optimistic Rollup. This innovation enables Morphism to combine the advantages of the two Rollup technologies and become one of the best solutions for Ethereum's scalability at present.

The documentation presents details on:
- What is Morphism and its Architecture
- Our Protocol Design to approach best Ethereum Scalability
- What roles can you play in the Morphism system and their importance
- How to develop/deploy Ethereum dapps on Morphism

## What makes Morphism different

- Optimistic Rollup with Validity(ZK) Proof
- Decentralized Sequencer Setup from Beginning
- Top-notch Scalability
- Seamless Ethereum Development Experience

Morphism is the first Optimistic ZK-Rollup which harnesses the benefits of both Op-Rollup and ZK-Rollup. Based on Morphism's native decentralized sequencer design, it can achieve a higher level of security than existing centralized Layer 2 solutions. Finally, developers and users on Morphism can use the same code, tooling, apps, etc that they use on Ethereum, but with much higher throughput and lower fees.

Ethereum developers can deploy their existing contracts to Morphism, and users can deposit assets from ethereum and transact off-chain. Morphism offers compatibility and scalability without compromise.
