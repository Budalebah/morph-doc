## Wallet

You need to have a wallet to interact with dApps on the Scroll Testnet. You can find some example wallets and configuration tips below.

### MetaMask
You can install MetaMask from their [official website](https://metamask.io/download/).

You need to import the Alpha Testnet configurations to your MetaMask wallet. To do this, click all Add to wallet buttons on the Morphism Testnet homepage. 

This will import the chain ID and RPC URLs for the Morhism Testnet. 

Morphism testnet usuing Ethereum sepolia testnet as the underlying L1 and it is configured on Metamask by default. To show it, click "Show/hide test networks" in the MetaMask network selection dropdown menu.


### Manual network configuration

Currently, the Add to wallet links may not be compatible with all wallets yet. If you are having issues using them, you may need to manually add the Sepolia Testnet and Morphism network by inserting the configuration details from the table below:


#### Network Configuration


| Name                      | RPC Url(s)                            | Chain ID | Block explorer             | Symbol |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Morphism Testnet             | https://rpc.testnet.morphism.xyz        | 2710    | https://explorer.testnet.morphism.xyz      | ETH      |


## Faucet

To interact with our testnet, you first need to receive testnet ETH on sepolia. 

Then you may bridge from sepolia Testnet to Scroll Alpha Testnet. 

Here are a few sepolia faucet apps:

Once you receive ETH on sepolia, you should see it in your wallet on the sepolia Network. 

It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction to your address on the [sepolia Block Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
