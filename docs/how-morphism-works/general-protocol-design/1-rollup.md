As the foundation of a Layer 2 project, the "Rollup" process refers to the process in which Layer 2 packages L2 transactions into batches and submits them to L1 along with the new L2 Global State. 

Within [Morphism's architecture](../2-morphism-modular-design.md), this process is carried out by the Sequencers' batch submitter components.

Morph's Rollup design takes into account the requirements of the protocol itself, improving the efficiency of Rollup and reducing its costs while ensuring that all necessary data is submitted to L1.
