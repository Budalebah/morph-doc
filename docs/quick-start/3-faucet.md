## Faucet

To interact with our testnet, you first need to receive testnet ETH on sepolia. 

Then you may bridge from sepolia Testnet to Scroll Alpha Testnet. 

Here are a few sepolia faucet apps:

Once you receive ETH on sepolia, you should see it in your wallet on the sepolia Network. 

It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction to your address on the [sepolia Block Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
