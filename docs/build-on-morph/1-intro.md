Welcome to the Morph developer docs!

Looking to build applications on top of Morph and don't know where to start?

Don't worry, we got you covered here! 

As the first optimistic zkEVM Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Morph is 100% EVM compatible.

Build on morph is just like build on Ethereum, if you have ethereum development experience, your code, tooling & dependencies will be also appliable on Morph.

## What's next

**Depending on what do you need**

- For the essentials: Check out the [development basics](../build-on-morph/build-on-morph/1-difference-between-morph-and-ethereum.md)
<!-- - For handy step by step [contract deployment tutorial](../build-on-morph/exmaples/1-bridge-erc20.md) -->
- You know everything you do, you just need the [developer resources](../build-on-morph/developer-resources/1-contracts.md) like contract address.
