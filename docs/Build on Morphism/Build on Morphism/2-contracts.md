# Start Developing on Morphism

Developing on Morphism is as easy as developing on Ethereum â€” literally!

To deploy contracts onto an morphism chain, simply set the RPC endpoint of your target morphism chain and deploy using your favorite Ethereum development framework;

- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart)

...it all just works!

For examples of deploying with hardhat see [practice examples](../Practice%20Examples/1-ERC20.md).

For info on new / different behavior between morphism and Ethereum, see [differences with Ethereum](./1-diff.md).

## Step 1: Network Configuration

Before you doing anything, make sure you are connected to the following Morphism Testnet.

| Name                      | RPC Url(s)                            | Chain ID | Block explorer             | Underlying L1 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Morphism Testnet             | https://rpc.testnet.morphism.xyz        | 2710    | https://explorer.testnet.morphism.xyz      | Ethereum      |


{
  "name": "Morphism Testnet",
  "chain": "ETH",
  "rpc": ["https://rpc.testnet.morphism.xyz"],
  "faucets": [],
  "nativeCurrency": {
    "name": "Ether",
    "symbol": "ETH",
    "decimals": 18
  },
  "infoURL": "https://morphism.xyz",
  "shortName": "morphism",
  "chainId": 2710,
  "networkId": 2710,
  "explorers": [
    {
      "name": "Morphism Testnet Explorer",
      "url": "https://explorer.testnet.morphism.xyz",
      "standard": "EIP3091"
    }


## Step 2: Set up your developing framework



### Hardhat

Modify your Hardhat config file hardhat.config.ts to point at the Morphism public RPC.
```
...

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  ...
  networks: {
    morphism: {
      url: "" || "",
      accounts:
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    },
  },
};

...
```

### Foundry

To deploy using Morphism Public RPC, run:
```
forge create ... --rpc-url= --legacy
```


### Truffle
Assuming you already have a truffle environment setup, go to the Truffle configuration file, truffle.js. Make sure to have installed HDWalletProvider: npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider@1.4.0
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider")

```
...
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    morphism: {
      provider: () =>
        new HDWalletProvider(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, ""),
      network_id: '*',
    },
  }
}

```

### Brownie

To add the Morphism, run the following command:
```
brownie networks add Ethereum morphism host= chainid=534353
```

To set this as your default network, add the following in your project config file:
```
networks:
    default: morphism    
```

Another way to add the Morphism is to create a yaml file and run a command to add it.

This is an example of a yaml file called network-config.yaml
```
live:
- name: Ethereum
 networks:
 - chainid: 534353
   explorer: https://
   host: https://
   id: morphism
   name: Morphism
```
To add Morphism to the network list, run the following command:
```
brownie networks import ./network-config.yaml
```

To deploy on Morphism, run the following command. In this example, token.py is the script to deploy the smart contract. Replace this with the name of your script:
```
brownie run token.py --network morphism
```

### ethers.js

Setting up a Morphism Alpha Testnet provider in an ethers script:
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

```
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://
);
```
## Step 3: Acquire Ether

To start building on Morphism, you may need to acquire some testnet ETH. 

Use faucet to acquire Sepolia Ether. 

And then you can bridge the test Ethereum Ether to Morphism testnet.
